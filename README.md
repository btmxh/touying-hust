# HUST touying template

A conformist HUST template for [touying](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying).

This is heavily based on the official Microsoft PowerPoint template 2022.

Currently supports two themes (`blue` and `red` (default)) at two aspect ratios (`4-3` and `16-9` (default)).

Since I don't have much experience with Typst scripting, this code _took quite a lot of inspiration_ from the source code of the [stargazer](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying/blob/main/themes/stargazer.typ) template.

*NOTE*: You need the [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) font for the best experience. It is an open font so that's as easy as typing `yay -S ttf-lato` into the terminal.

## Example

See the [example](https://github.com/btmxh/touying-hust/tree/master/examples) for a quick example I wrote in a night (along with the library code). Its content is based on my notes while reading [this](http://web.stanford.edu/~marykw/classes/CS250_W19/readings/Forney_Introduction_to_Finite_Fields.pdf).
